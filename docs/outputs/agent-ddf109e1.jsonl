I understand the project context:\n\n**Project Summary:**\n- ClankerOS is an experimental x86 OS built collaboratively between a human architect and Claude\n- Written in C for the kernel, using GNU Make for building\n- Currently has bootloader support, VGA/serial output, GDT, IDT, ISR/IRQ handlers, PIC, and PIT implemented\n- Next milestone is memory management (physical allocator, virtual memory, heap)\n\n**Key Guidelines I'll follow:**\n- Use PascalCase with module prefixes for public functions (Vid, Mem, Pic, Pit, Clc, K, etc.)\n- camelCase for local variables and static globals\n- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants/macros\n- K&R brace style\n- Read-only mode only - no file modifications, creations, or deletions\n\n**How I can help:**\n- Search and locate specific files or implementations\n- Find function definitions and usage patterns\n- Analyze code structure and relationships\n- Explore the build system and directory layout\n- Review session notes and documentation\n\nWhat would you like me to help you explore or find in the ClankerOS codebase?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3006,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CW3JAMKkQRMZyEpomxhh2","type":"assistant","uuid":"b98ff724-d568-4fed-b58d-ca207330c2c3","timestamp":"2025-12-12T18:51:34.834Z"}
