I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm in read-only mode for exploring the ClankerOS codebase.\n\nKey points I've absorbed from CLAUDE.md:\n\n- **Project**: ClankerOS - experimental x86 OS built collaboratively by human architect and Claude\n- **Languages**: C kernel, C++ userspace\n- **Build**: GNU Make with cross-compiler toolchain\n- **Architecture**: Modular kernel with arch-specific (arch/i386/) and architecture-independent (core/) components\n- **Design patterns**: Writer interface trait-object pattern, interrupt architecture with assembly stubs and C handlers\n- **Naming conventions**: PascalCase with prefixes (Vid, Mem, Pic, Pit, Gdt, Idt, Isr, Irq, ECon, Clc), camelCase for locals/statics, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants\n- **Brace style**: K&R style\n- **x86 I/O**: Direct instruction names (outb, inb, io_wait)\n- **Status**: Completed through Session 3 - boot, VGA, GDT, IDT, ISR, IRQ, PIC, PIT, early console, printf. Next: Memory Management\n- **Workflow**: Check TODO.md, follow CODING_STYLE.md, test with make run-serial, update docs, copy Claude data before commits\n\nI'm ready to search and analyze the codebase. I will NOT create, modify, or delete any files. What would you like me to find?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3011,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CW2GRSxGe8PZx1K7hwR18","type":"assistant","uuid":"0ac4dac4-8f4e-4939-9082-be5bdffa7a0c","timestamp":"2025-12-12T05:48:11.036Z"}
